# I. Abstract of the Project	

This section will discuss the topics of Jacobian matrix, singularities, differential equations, and path and trajectory planning for cylindrical manipulators, all of which are essential for meeting the Final Requirements in Robotics 2. Industrial fields commonly use cylindrical manipulators because of their simple structure, ease of use, and controllability. For this, we start by calculating the Jacobian matrix for a cylindrical manipulator and then creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to verify the accuracy of the answers. We highlight the significance of the Jacobian matrix in calculating both the joint and end-effector velocities. The investigation continues with the identification and classification of determinants using the basket method to determine the singularities within the manipulator's workspace, as well as their implications for motion planning and control strategies. We develop differential equations that govern the manipulator's dynamics, establishing the foundation for comprehending its behavior under diverse operating conditions. We then focus on path and trajectory planning, using the Jacobian matrix to create algorithms that ensure smooth, collision-free motion. Simulations using a virtual machine and MATLAB validate the proposed methodologies, showcasing their effectiveness in enhancing manipulator performance. The findings help to optimize cylindrical manipulator operations and provide insights into advanced robotic system design and control.

# II. Introduction of the Project	

The field of robotics has seen significant advancements in recent decades, with manipulators playing a crucial role in various industrial applications. Among these, cylindrical manipulators are particularly noteworthy due to their simplicity, reliability, and ease of control. Tasks such as assembly, welding, and material handling extensively use these manipulators, characterized by their cylindrical coordinate system. Understanding and optimizing their performance necessitates a thorough examination of several key concepts, including the Jacobian matrix, singularities, differential equations, and path and trajectory planning.

The Jacobian matrix is fundamental in robotics, providing a mathematical tool that relates the joint velocities of a manipulator to its end-effector velocities. This relationship is critical for a manipulator to fully understand the motion and control required for its proper function. When the Jacobian matrix loses rank at determinant points in the manipulator's workspace, there are problems like joint speeds that never end and losing control. Identifying and managing these singularities is essential for ensuring safe and efficient operation.
Differential equations govern the dynamics of cylindrical manipulators, describing how they respond to various forces, velocities, and torques. These equations form the basis for developing control strategies that can predict and influence the manipulator's behavior. Effective path and trajectory planning further enhances the manipulator's performance, enabling it to execute precise and smooth movements while avoiding obstacles and singularities and making a collision-free motion.
This paper aims to provide a detailed analysis and lessons from these interconnected aspects. We start by deriving the Jacobian matrix for a cylindrical manipulator and exploring its properties. Next, we identify singularities by solving the determinants within the workspace and discussing their implications. We then formulate the differential equations that describe the manipulator's dynamics, setting the stage for advanced control techniques. Finally, we delve into path and trajectory planning, presenting algorithms that leverage the Jacobian matrix to achieve optimal motion planning. Aside from this, we also formulate a GUI calculator that everyone can use to check values for this Jacobian matrix. Through simulations, we validate our approaches, demonstrating their practical applicability and effectiveness.

By integrating these key concepts, this paper contributes to the broader understanding and enhancement of cylindrical manipulator operations. We aim to use the insights gained here to develop robotic systems that are more efficient, reliable, and versatile, thereby advancing the field of industrial automation.
